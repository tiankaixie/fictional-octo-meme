summary: |
  I design and develop visual analytics tools to help people understand and reason about machine learning models. My research interests include Visual Analytics, Explainable AI, and Human-Computer Interaction. My goal is to make machine learning more transparent, fair, and understandable for everyone so that we can build more trustworthy and equitable AI systems.
